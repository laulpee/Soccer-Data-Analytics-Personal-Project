Project: Soccer Data Analysis for Goals & Shooting Statistics
Type: Personal Project
Project Analyst: Paul Lee
Date: May 2022


File: shotHeatMap_statsDashboard.py
This python code analyzes the main Shot dataset from 7 games played and outputs a Shooting Heat Map and a Dashboard of 
Pie Charts & Tables for Shooting Statistics for each player and the entire league. This code reads the "fullDataSet" and 
"fieldLocationMap" CSV files to run the analysis.


File: closeGoal_farGoal.py
This python code analyzes the main Shot dataset from 7 games played and outputs a Scatter Plot that plots the close-range 
goal % on the x-axis and plots the far-range foal % on the y-axis for each player in the league. This code reads the 
"fullDataSet" CSV file to run the analysis.


File: firstHalfGoals_2ndHalfGoals.py
This python code analyzes the main Shot dataset from 7 games played and outputs a Scatter Plot that plots the 1st-Half 
Goals on the x-axis and plots the 2nd-Half Goals on the y-axis for each player in the league. This code reads the "fullDataSet" 
CSV file to run the analysis.
